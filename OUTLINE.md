# outline

1. General algorithm: B (Basic backtracking)
2. Example
    - using B
    - applying optimizations
        - factoring
        - B* (for queen problem)
        - W (Walker's backtrack (simply precompute all xt for which P holds))
        - L (for permutations/langford pairs)
        - Word rectangles (using a pretty interesting data structure)
        - dynamic ordering of choices (steps out of order)
        - C (commafree codes)
3. Running time estimates (Monte Carlo)
    - example?
